# Mygoal

Hi, I'm Phan Minh Tri, a passionate learner in the field of Networking and Cybersecurity. Currently, I am focused on enhancing my skills and accelerating my learning to stay competitive with others in the industry.

During my studies at university, I first encountered networking and cybersecurity topics, but mostly in a theoretical context. Over time, I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in this field, so I took it upon myself to dive deeper by self-learning through various online platforms and resources.

To date, I have completed CCNA and have hands-on experience with various network labs using tools like Packet Tracer and EVE-NG. I'm also currently learning Linux as I recognize its importance in networking and cybersecurity.

 **My Mission**: Through these practical simulations, I have gained a deeper understanding of concepts I studied earlier, which has motivated me to seek out a real-world environment where I can continue to grow, tackle new challenges, and optimize network infrastructure.

 **My Goal**: is to enhance the performance and security of enterprise networks and gain more experience in solving real-world problems. I'm looking forward to opportunities where I can continue to learn and contribute to meaningful projects.
